Description: 16S rRNA sequence data is oftentimes extremely sparse, making it
    difficult to normalize properly for differential abundance analyses with current
    RNA-Seq methods, such as DESeq, edgeR, and metagenomeSeq. The count adjustment
    methods included here can be used to ameliorate these effects. The Good-Turing
    adjustment is derived from from Good-Turing frequency estimation methods. Code
    to generate simulated test data according to the Dirichlet-multinomial model
    from two different sets of parameters is also included. Further information on
    the methods and data can be found *IN THIS PAPER*.
